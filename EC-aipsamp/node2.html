Orbital Electron Capture</A>
</H2>
In 1935, Yukawa proposed that a proton, bound in an atomic nucleus,  could capture a low lying, bound atomic electron, transforming into a neutron, and releasing an electron neutrino.

This may be called orbital electron capture, K-electron capture, or just electron capture (E.C.) 

<P>
Electron capture usually occurs in unstable radioisotopes which lack the nuclear binding energy <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline917#</SPAN> to decay by the more familiar Beta decay processes (<tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math38#<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline919#</SPAN>). The typical <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline921#</SPAN> energies necessary are

When <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline929#</SPAN>, which is twice the rest mass of an electron <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline931#</SPAN>, a proton rich nucleus must decay by electron capture. 

<P>
In particular, heavy elements may decay by E.C. and/or <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline933#</SPAN> (positron emission) to a lower 'magic number' of stable nuclei, and by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline935#</SPAN> decay to achieve a higher magic number.    E.C. is favored for high Z nuclei, but because of the energetic constraint, very light elements, such as <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline937#</SPAN>, decay by primarily by E.C.    Lacking any binding energy and/or internal nucleon structure, bare proton electron capture is not observed, and requires extreme, exotic conditions.

<P>
We observe electron capture by observing the resulting transmuted nuclei and/or the radiative relaxation processes.  The captured electron is bound to the atom, and it is usually a K-shell electron, but may be L or higher.  The nucleus may then absorb some energy, becoming excited, and then undergo internal conversion.  During this, another higher lying, bound atomic electron is absorbed, and either an X-ray or Auger electron released [see Figure <A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#fig:ec1#39><tex2html_cr_mark></A>].

Because electron capture occurs in proton-rich nuclei, and, subsequently, releases a X-Ray photon, the reaction is also sometimes written as

(where Z is the total number of protons and neutrons, A the number protons, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline941#</SPAN> is an X-ray photon)

<P>
Indeed, orbital electron capture is evidenced by high intensity x-rays and soft electrons.  In 1938, Luis W. Alvarez observed the x-ray signature of orbital electron capture in activated Titanium [#alvarez#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Since then, electron capture has been observed in about 150 radioactive isotopes.
