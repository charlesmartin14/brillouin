Confinement Induced Electron Capture</A>
</H1>

<P>
We pose the following Gedankenexperiment:   Suppose we confine a bare proton (and an electron) in a particle-in-a-box of volume <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline1001#</SPAN>.  What box size L will 'induce' electron confinement ?  Here, we examine what do detailed calculations look like that employ the full machinery of the Weak interaction, as an illustrative exercise.

<P>
We write this as

<P>
<BR><P></P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER" CLASS="mathdisplay">
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math57#

<tex2html_image_mark>#displaymath1003#
</DIV><BR CLEAR="ALL">
<P></P>

<P>
where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline1005#</SPAN> is the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">confinement energy</SPAN>, which is induced by the box constraints. 

<P>
