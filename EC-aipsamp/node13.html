Metallic Hydrides</A>

<P>
It has been suggested that bare proton-electron capture could actually arise metallic hydrides, such as PdH and NiH, as a result of some exotic, here-to-fore unrecognized physical mechanism.  Widom and Larsen, in particular, have proposed that the effective Q value for bare proton E.C. would be lowered because the surface electrons may undergo mass renormalization due surface plasmon radiation, leading to high order radiative corrections to the Weak interaction pair production process [#widlar1#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].  One may define an effective mass <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline989#</SPAN> using

where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline993#</SPAN> is the gauge potential for the fluctuating surface plasmon radiation, and assuming <tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math56#<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline995#</SPAN>

<P>
They argue that such a renormalization may be possible because the neutron scattering experiments on PdH show a collective proton oscillation that would be resonate with electronic surface plasmons.

<P>
Outside of any new physics, is there any other plausible mechanism for E.C. in a metallic hydride ?  Any such process would be energetically bound by the uncertainty principle, meaning that the hydrogen atom would be under extreme confinement.

<P>
Curiously, neutron scattering experiments do show that in PdH, that the hydrogen atoms  have a root-mean-square vibrational amplitude of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline997#</SPAN> (at <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline999#</SPAN>), which is anomalously small [#ferguson#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
