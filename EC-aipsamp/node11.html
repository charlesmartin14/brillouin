Bare proton-electron capture</A>

<P>
We frequently write electron capture as if it were simply proton-electron capture

At zero energy, proton electron capture is not possible because it violates energy-momentum conservation. Theoretically, a free proton can could capture an electron from the continuum, but the interaction energy must be  above threshold for neutron production.  This is a huge amount of energy, although this happens regularly in accelerators, and, presumably, in stellar environments.

<P>
Observing proton electron capture outside of an accelerator, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">on the desktop</SPAN>, so to speak, would be an incredibly hard experiment because both final particles are neutral, and  the neutrino is extremely weakly interacting.
