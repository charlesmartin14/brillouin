Stellar Nucleosynthesis</A>

<P>
Bare proton-electron capture is thought to occur  in the early stages of the big bang and in stellar nucleosynthesis.  It is thought to drive the formation of primordial elements, and to occur in the forming of neutron stars.   

<P>
At very high temperatures, the proton electron collisions have sufficient energy to overcome the reaction barrier.   For example, Bachall and coworkers have studied the electron capture rate in stellar media, and have computed the electron capture rate of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline983#</SPAN> in the Sun [#bachall62#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#bachall69#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. And it is believed that ionized Hydrogen captures an electron during the core collapse supernovae and in neutron stars [14]; in fact, it is thought to create stellar instability.   

<P>
While we usually characterize a star by it's temperature, these are also very dense systems, with <tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math53#<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline985#</SPAN>.  In contrast, the smallest star has density <tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math54#<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline987#</SPAN> [?]  As important, the reverse reaction is prohibited because, inside the dense neutron star, it is impossible to create a new electron; the Fermi sea is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">full</SPAN>.

<P>
So electron capture can occur by bare protons, but, presumably, only under extreme confinement (and with the reverse reaction is suppressed).
