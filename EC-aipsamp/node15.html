Neutron post-reaction</A>
</H3>

<P>
To prevent the reverse reaction, we assume that the free neutron subsequently combines with another proton, and gives us 2.2 MeV of energy in the process.  This post-process contributes to the power output, and prevents the reverse reaction.  Realistically, we expect this to happen at the maximum box size, at the energy threshold, where the outbound neutron has very low momentum and therefore a very small mean free path.  

<P>
Still, for illustrative purposes, we will compute the power output,  assuming this post-reaction,  at all box sizes.
