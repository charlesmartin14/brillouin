Positron emission</A>
</H3> 

<P>
In particular, any high energy relativisitic process, we have to worry about positron emission.  We noted above, however, that in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline977#</SPAN>, the competing positron decay reaction can not occur because there is not enough energy.  Generally, this occurs at length scales below the Compton length of the electron, which, is smaller than we will need to consider.
