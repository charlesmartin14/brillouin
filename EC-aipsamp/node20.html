Transition Rates and Power Calculations</A>

<P>
Orbital electron capture and other Beta-decay processes follow first order kinetics, so the capture rate is described by a single number. 
To calculate the rate, we require a full relativistic, quantum mechanical treatment because the capture process involves both creating particles and the kinetic energy spectrum is of order <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline1029#</SPAN>.

<P>
The capture rate <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline1031#</SPAN> is given by multiplying the cross section <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline1033#</SPAN> by the incident velocity <tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math65#<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline1035#</SPAN> and electronic (box) density <tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math66#<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline1037#</SPAN> of the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline1039#</SPAN> pair at the origin

We will compute the electronic density classically, using box wavefunctions, and, for each box size, determine the incident velocity (really momentum). We then compute the cross section using full relativistic kinematics and Dirac spinors.
