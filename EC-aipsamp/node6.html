Neutron Decay</A>
</H3> 

<P>
By detailed balance,  reverse electron capture has the same rate as orbital electron capture--but is more favorable energetically.  Indeed, inside the nucleus, the neutron is relatively stable. Free neutron decay has mean lifetime of <tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math50#<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline969#</SPAN>, or about 15 minutes. 

<P>
In contrast, orbital electron capture by a free proton is unspoken-of outside of a stellar environments. Even if the bare reaction could proceed, the reverse reaction would still dominate un
less it is suppressed or is kinetically unfavorable.
