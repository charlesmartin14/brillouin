The Weak Interaction and V-A theory</A>
</H2>

<P>
Electron capture is mediated by the Weak interaction, described most concisely by the Fermi V-A (Vector Axial) theory [#fermi1#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ec-review1#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ec-review2#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
The V-A theory is a simple phenomenological approach, readily amenable to numerical calculations.  While It is now understood in terms of ElectroWeak Unification and can be derived from the Standard Model, the original paper by Fermi, for which he won the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics, was initially rejected by <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Nature</SPAN> because ;SPMquot;It contained speculations too remote from reality to be of interest to the reader;SPMquot; [#close#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
V-A theory is used to compute cross sections for scattering experiments and decay rates for electron capture for various atoms,  even in different environments, chemical and otherwise.  We can use machinery of the V-A theory to explore E.C. in a simple, idealized environment.  To properly describe any reaction, however, we need to understand what reactions we can apply the theory to, and the other, potential competing reactions.
