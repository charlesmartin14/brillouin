Radiative Electron Capture</A>
</H3>

<P>
Also, in very rare cases, a gamma ray photon is emitted with the neutrino; this is called Radiative Electron Capture (REC) [#glauber1#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#glauber2#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#Jauch#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#roec2007#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. This can be thought of as a kind of Internal Bremsstrahlung (or so-called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">braking</SPAN>) radiation, caused by the electron accelerating toward the nucleus during capture,  taking energy away from outbound neutrino[#jackson#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. It is traditionally been treated as a second order QED correction to the V-A theory [#Jauch#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].  REC is 1000X less likely, but does occur.   The resulting gamma rays are called soft because they do not exhibit sharp spectral lines.    Recent, detailed rate calculations have elucidated the quantum mechanical details [#roec2007#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
