Inverse Beta Decay</A>
</H3> 

<P>
Electron capture is also sometimes called inverse <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline971#</SPAN> decay, but, here, we mean this to be the scattering of a proton and an electron anti-neutrino <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline973#</SPAN>.  It is characterized by emission of a positron <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline975#</SPAN>. 

<P>
