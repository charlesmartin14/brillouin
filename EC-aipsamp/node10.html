Rate calculations</A>

<P>
The electron capture rate can be computed using the Fermi VA-Theory [#ec-review1#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ec-review2#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].  The most basic calculations require a only specifying the electronic wavefunctions(s), averaging over the possible electron-proton momenta, and numerically integrating over the outbound neutrino momentum.  We describe this below.

<P>
The V-A theory is based on second order perturbation theory.  It assumes an incoherent nuclear process, it is local, and that the interaction is phenomenological. It is treated as a simply a contact potential at the surface of the nucleus. Here, this means we need to compute the nuclear charge--the electron density on the surface of the nucleus <tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math51#<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline979#</SPAN>, which we obtain from a classical particle-in-the-box wavefunction (below).

<P>
More complicated calculations are used for larger nuclei, second order processes, etc.  They only require modifications to treat either atomic electronic structure of reactant and product atoms, and/or specific considerations for nuclear internal conversion and other second order processes.
