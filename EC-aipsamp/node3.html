Effect of Chemical Environment of Electron Capture rate</A>
</H3>

<P>
The lightest element that E.C. has been observed in is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline943#</SPAN>[#radbook#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. In fact, there is so little energy that the competing <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline945#</SPAN> positron emission process (described below) is prohibited, leading to a fairly long E.C. half-life of <tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math43#<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline947#</SPAN>.

<P>
Being so light, and having such a large rate, electron capture in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline949#</SPAN> can be slightly modified by both changing the chemical environment and/or the external pressure [#wang#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#raydas#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ohtsuki#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. In particular, in 2004, Ohtsuki et. al. demonstrated a change of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline951#</SPAN> by embedding Be in C-60 cages [#ohtsuki#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
How could such changes occur?  The nuclear energy levels are in the keV to MeV region, and it is generally thought to be very difficult to impossible to effect.  But the electron capture rate is proportional to electronic density at the surface of the nucleus--<SPAN  CLASS="textit">the nuclear charge</SPAN>.   The electronic energy levels are in the eV range, so intense EM fields can alter the electronic structure and therefore slightly affect the E.C. rate.
