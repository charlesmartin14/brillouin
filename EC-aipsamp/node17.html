Klein Paradox</A>
</H3>

<P>
Klein noted that a relativistic (Dirac) particle-in-a-box will <SPAN  CLASS="textit">leak out</SPAN> at box sizes near the Compton wavelength; this called the Klein paradox [#klein1#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#klein2#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].  And while this is usually taught as being simply particle-antiparticle creation, it has been suggested that the Klein paradox it can occur even at larger boxes sizes, and it is a general phenomena of confined relativistic particles.  And recent experiments on Graphene have reopened the debate [#klein3#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Still, we will assume the traditional interpretation and that we can ignore the Klein paradox.

<P>
So we use a classical box, with minimum size <tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math63#<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline1025#</SPAN>.  We compute the maximum size below.

<P>
