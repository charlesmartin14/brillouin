    "\n",
    "We describe a Gedandkenexperiment in which a bare proton can capture an electron due soley to confinement.  We provide numerical solution of the Fermi VA-Theory for K-electron capture for an electron-proton pair  confined in a classical box of size L.  Interestingly, we find that the capture is most likely for L=0.004-0.009 Angstroms, and unlikely for L < 0.004 Angstroms."

    "\n",
    "Current candidates for proton decay [1] place the proton lifetime at ~10^30 - 10^34 years, all of which are longer than the known lifetime of the universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, most theoreticians beleive they must decay to have a matter-imbalance difference in the early universe. For example, the g the Georgi-Glashow Grand Unified Theory (GUT) predicts a proton would decay into an positron and a pion\n",
