    "\n",
    "We describe a Gedandkenexperiment in which a bare proton can capture an electron due soley to confinement.  We provide numerical solution of the Fermi VA-Theory for K-electron capture for an electron-proton pair  confined in a classical box of size L.  Interestingly, we find that the capture is most likely for L=0.004-0.009 Angstroms, and unlikely for L < 0.004 Angstroms."
